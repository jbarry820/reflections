What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? This creates a GIT repository. I need to do this so I can make backups to GIT.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? The staging area is a temporary area where you add the files you want to commit. The value is that i may need to take out a file before I commit it.
