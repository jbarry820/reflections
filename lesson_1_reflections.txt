How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I was able to find the word that was spelled incorrectly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I would be able to restore a file to a previous version if I had made changes that did not work.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Cons - I may forget to save the file. Pro - I get specific saves.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log - this gives me the log so I can get the commit id. git diff - this gives me the lines that were changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? If I break something, I know that I can get a backup.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? I want to use GIT to backup my work in the cloud.
